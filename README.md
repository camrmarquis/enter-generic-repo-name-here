# Fuck You Brandon
Fuck You Brandon is a weekly job that will start running the Tuesday following week 1 of the 2021 NFL season. The primary aim of Fuck You Brandon is to analyze starting lineups from across the league for the previous week to detect evidence of tanking. A report will be autogenerated and sent out on a weekly basis to the entire league.

Perhaps I will also expand to analyze other cool stuff the seems a little less witch-hunty.
